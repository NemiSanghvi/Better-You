# Better You

**Better You** is a calm, offline-first **AI-powered self-improvement app** built with React Native (Expo).  
It helps users focus on improving **one meaningful thing** by delivering **one task per day**, without overwhelm, feeds, or distractions.

The app is intentionally minimal and designed around consistency, clarity, and respectful accountability.

---

## ✨ Core Idea

> One intent.  
> One companion.  
> One task per day.

Better You is not about motivation spikes or productivity dashboards.  
It’s about showing up every day and doing one small, meaningful action.

---

## 🚀 Features (v1)

### 🧠 Intent-based onboarding
- On first launch, the app asks:
  > **“What do you want to be better at this year?”**
- Users are encouraged to be precise and intentional.

---

### 🔔 Notification Companion
Users choose a **companion tone** that affects task wording and notifications:

- **Friend** – calm, supportive, forgiving  
- **Coach** – firm, accountable, motivating  
- **Drill Sergeant** – strict and blunt (not abusive)

This creates personalized accountability without social pressure.

---

### 📅 One task per day
- Tasks are generated once and stored locally
- Difficulty increases gradually over time
- Only **today’s task** is actionable

---

### 🗓 Weekly timeline
- Past completed tasks are visible and struck through
- Today’s task is highlighted
- **Future tasks are intentionally hidden** to reduce anxiety and comparison

---

### 🌐 Offline-first
- Works completely offline after setup
- No accounts
- No cloud sync
- No feeds
- No noise
